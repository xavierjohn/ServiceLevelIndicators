# RFC: Trellis ServiceLevelIndicators metric contract

## Status

Implemented in the pre-1.0 metric contract finalization.

## Context

`Trellis.ServiceLevelIndicators` is part of the Trellis AI-first .NET framework. Its role is to provide structural observability guardrails for generated and hand-written services by emitting service-level latency metrics with stable, meaningful dimensions.

The library is currently in the .NET 10 preview/alpha phase. The changes in this RFC finalize the intended pre-1.0 metric contract; no migration guide is required for previous alpha behavior.

## Standards and platform alignment

The design aligns with:

| Source | Usage |
|---|---|
| Google SRE | SLI/SLO semantics, valid requests, excluded traffic, error budgets |
| OpenTelemetry | .NET metric emission, histograms, meter registration, optional HTTP/API dimensions |
| OpenSLO | Documentation examples for portable SLO definitions; no runtime support initially |
| Microsoft Azure Monitor / Application Insights | KQL examples and Azure operational guidance |
| Trellis backend contract | Required dimensions and SLI-focused naming |

## Metric

The primary metric remains:

| Metric | Type | Unit | Required dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `operation.duration` | Histogram | `ms` | `CustomerResourceId`, `LocationId`, `Operation`, `Outcome` |

`operation.count` is not added initially. Success-rate and availability queries should use the histogram count produced by `operation.duration`. A separate count metric may be reconsidered only if backend constraints prove histogram count is insufficient.

`operation.duration` is a custom Trellis SLI metric, not an OpenTelemetry semantic-convention metric. The unit is intentionally milliseconds (`ms`), even though OpenTelemetry HTTP duration semantic conventions use seconds.

## Required dimensions

These dimensions are mandatory and emitted exactly:

- `CustomerResourceId`
- `LocationId`
- `Operation`
- `Outcome`

Dimension sources:

| Dimension | Source / fallback |
|---|---|
| `CustomerResourceId` | Explicit/default resource identifier; fallback `Unknown` |
| `LocationId` | Required startup configuration; fail fast when missing or empty |
| `Operation` | Caller-supplied operation; ASP.NET uses explicit override, route template, then `<METHOD> <unrouted>` |
| `Outcome` | Explicit outcome, helper inference, middleware inference, or default `Ignored` |

Manual/background operations throw `ArgumentException` when `Operation` is null, empty, or whitespace. ASP.NET unrouted fallback uses uppercase HTTP method formatting, for example `GET <unrouted>`.

`LocationId` is startup-only. It cannot be overridden per operation or request.

Optional HTTP/API dimensions use OpenTelemetry-style names, including:

- `http.request.method`
- `http.response.status.code`
- `http.api.version`

The required PascalCase dimensions intentionally deviate from OpenTelemetry attribute naming conventions because they are part of the Trellis backend contract.

## Outcome model

C# code should expose:

```csharp
public enum SliOutcome
{
    Success,
    Failure,
    ClientError,
    Ignored
}
```

Metrics emit the dimension:

```text
Outcome = "Success" | "Failure" | "ClientError" | "Ignored"
```

Emit outcome values through explicit string mapping. Do not rely on enum `ToString()` for the wire value.
Wire values are case-sensitive.

SLO semantics:

| Outcome | Meaning | SLO usage |
|---|---|---|
| `Success` | Operation completed successfully | Numerator and denominator |
| `Failure` | Service failed to satisfy the operation | Counted as a valid event; not counted as good |
| `ClientError` | Client/request/input problem, reported separately | Excluded from default success-rate denominator |
| `Ignored` | Not part of SLI measurement | Excluded |

Default success-rate formula:

```text
success_rate = count(Outcome == "Success") / (count(Outcome == "Success") + count(Outcome == "Failure"))
```

`ClientError` and `Ignored` are excluded from the default denominator. Services may report `ClientError` separately or opt into policy-specific SLO formulas.

Outcome precedence:

1. Explicit user-set outcome.
2. Helper inference.
3. Middleware inference.
4. Default `Ignored`.

Unhandled exceptions escaping the measured operation are an explicit exception to precedence and force `Failure`.

## ASP.NET classification defaults

| HTTP status/result | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 2xx | `Success` |
| 3xx | `Success` |
| 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 412, 422 | `ClientError` |
| 429 | `Failure` by default; configurable |
| 5xx | `Failure` |
| Client disconnect / request-aborted cancellation | `Ignored` |
| Unhandled exception | `Failure` |

Application/business cancellations remain configurable.

429 reduces success rate by default because throttling is treated as a service capacity/backpressure signal. Services that treat 429 as client-driven may classify it as `ClientError`.

3xx responses are `Success` by default because redirects and cache-validation responses can be successful service behavior. Redirect loops should be monitored through status-code queries or classifier overrides.

For exceptions, record the final `HttpContext.Response.StatusCode`. If an unhandled exception escapes and no status was set, emit `http.response.status.code = 500`.

ASP.NET emits these optional dimensions by default:

- `http.request.method`
- `http.response.status.code`

API version remains opt-in through `.AddApiVersion()` and emits:

- `http.api.version`

## Manual measurement

Manual/background operations default to `Outcome = Ignored` unless explicitly set or inferred by helper APIs.

Core APIs should include outcome-oriented methods such as:

```csharp
measuredOperation.SetOutcome(SliOutcome.Success);
```

Core `Measure(...)` and `MeasureAsync(...)` helpers should infer:

- `Success` on normal completion.
- `Failure` on exception.
- `Ignored` on `OperationCanceledException`.

Core helpers are not ASP.NET-specific and do not detect client disconnects. ASP.NET middleware maps `HttpContext.RequestAborted` / request-aborted cancellation to `Ignored`; application/business cancellations remain configurable.

Result-aware helpers for Trellis `Result<T>` belong in the optional `Trellis.ServiceLevelIndicators.Results` package, not in the core package.

## Activity correlation

`activity.status.code` is removed from default metric dimensions.

The library should continue updating `Activity.Current` status for trace correlation. Activity status is not the source of SLI outcome.

Activity status mapping:

| Outcome | Activity status |
|---|---|
| `Success` | `Ok` |
| `Failure` | `Error` |
| `ClientError` | `Unset` |
| `Ignored` | `Unset` |

## Unknown customer resource

When no customer resource is known, emit:

```text
CustomerResourceId = "Unknown"
```

Diagnostics:

- Log a one-time warning per operation/location when `CustomerResourceId = Unknown`.
- Increment `sli.diagnostics.unknown_customer_resource_id` every time `CustomerResourceId = Unknown`.
- Do not throw, drop, cap, or replace required dimensions by default.

`Unknown` is deliberate and distinct from `ActivityStatusCode.Unset`.

The one-time warning scope is per process lifetime. The implementation should bound the warning cache to avoid unbounded memory growth.

Diagnostic counter contract:

| Instrument | Type | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| `sli.diagnostics.unknown_customer_resource_id` | `Counter<long>` | `Operation`, `LocationId` |

## Meter

The default meter name remains:

```text
Trellis.SLI
```

Custom meter registration remains supported. All SLI metrics and diagnostic counters should use the configured meter consistently.

## Implementation design

### Core recording

`ServiceLevelIndicator` owns the `operation.duration` histogram and the `sli.diagnostics.unknown_customer_resource_id` counter. Both instruments use the default `Trellis.SLI` meter or the configured custom meter.

Every duration recording emits:

- `CustomerResourceId`
- `LocationId`
- `Operation`
- `Outcome`
- any custom dimensions

Custom dimensions must not reuse required names, reserved names, or optional dimensions already present on the measurement. Schema collisions throw immediately. The diagnostics-only rule applies to suspicious values, not to schema collisions.

### MeasuredOperation

`MeasuredOperation` stores `SliOutcome`, defaulting to `Ignored`.

Public API:

```csharp
measuredOperation.SetOutcome(SliOutcome.Success);
```

Internal behavior:

- Disposing records elapsed milliseconds.
- Disposing records the explicit or inferred `Outcome`.
- Raw `StartMeasuring(...)`/`Dispose()` cannot detect escaping exceptions and records the explicit/default outcome.
- `Measure(...)`, `MeasureAsync(...)`, and ASP.NET middleware can force `Failure` when they observe an exception.
- `Dispose()` remains idempotent.
- `SetOutcome(...)` after disposal has no effect.

### Helper APIs

Core helper APIs should infer outcomes:

| Result | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Normal completion | `Success` |
| Exception | `Failure` |
| `OperationCanceledException` | `Ignored` |

Helpers rethrow exceptions and cancellations after setting the inferred outcome.
Rethrows should use `throw;` so exception stack traces are preserved.

If user code explicitly sets `Failure` inside a helper and completes normally, explicit `Failure` remains. Helper success inference does not promote it to `Success`. Unhandled exceptions observed by helpers still force `Failure`.

### ASP.NET middleware

Middleware owns ASP.NET request measurement. Core helpers and ASP.NET middleware normally do not co-apply to the same `MeasuredOperation`; precedence exists for explicit outcomes, inferred outcomes, and future extension points.

Middleware should:

- resolve `Operation` from explicit metadata, route template, then uppercase `<METHOD> <unrouted>`,
- set `CustomerResourceId` from endpoint metadata when present,
- default missing customer resource to `Unknown`,
- classify outcome using configured classifier first, then the default table,
- emit `http.request.method` and `http.response.status.code` by default,
- run enrichments before recording,
- rethrow unhandled exceptions after recording failure semantics.

### Classifier extensibility

The first implementation should provide a global HTTP outcome classifier option. Exact per-route classifier API shape is intentionally left for implementation design and can follow after the global classifier.

Classifier behavior:

- returned `SliOutcome` wins over default status mapping,
- no result / null falls back to default status mapping,
- unhandled exceptions still force `Failure`.

### API versioning

The API versioning package remains an enrichment package. It continues to emit `http.api.version` only when `.AddApiVersion()` is called and does not participate in outcome classification.

## Dimension stability guardrails

The rule is stable and meaningful dimensions, not low cardinality.

`CustomerResourceId` may legitimately have very high cardinality at Microsoft/Azure scale, such as user object IDs in login services. Required dimensions must pass through exactly by default.

Default behavior:

- Required dimensions: diagnostics only; never mutate by default.
- Optional/custom dimensions: diagnostics only by default.
- Strict blocking or replacement: opt-in only.
- Runtime suspicious-value heuristics are off by default to avoid hot-path overhead at high scale; analyzers and documentation are the default guardrails.

Diagnostics should look for unstable values such as:

- request IDs,
- timestamps,
- raw paths,
- arbitrary text,
- generated-per-request GUIDs,
- emails when a stable object ID is available.

Analyzer support is a later milestone.

## Package architecture

Core SLI package remains independent from `Trellis.Core`.

Optional Trellis integration package:

```text
Trellis.ServiceLevelIndicators.Results
```

Dependency direction:

```text
Trellis.ServiceLevelIndicators.Results
    -> Trellis.ServiceLevelIndicators
    -> Trellis.Core
```

Neither core package depends on the Results integration package.

## Documentation requirements

Docs should include:

- Google SRE-aligned SLO semantics.
- OpenTelemetry metric setup.
- OpenSLO examples, documentation only.
- Azure Monitor / Application Insights KQL examples.
- Success-rate queries using `operation.duration` histogram count.
- Latency percentile queries.
- Client-error rate queries.
- Unknown `CustomerResourceId` detection.
- OpenTelemetry View/cardinality-limit guidance for services that intentionally use high-cardinality `CustomerResourceId` values.

## Testing support

Use TDD by phase: write or adjust failing tests first, implement the smallest passing change, then refactor.

Core and ASP.NET tests should cover outcome values, diagnostics, exception/cancellation paths, Activity status mapping, required dimensions, and custom meter behavior. Custom meter tests must verify both `operation.duration` and `sli.diagnostics.unknown_customer_resource_id` use the configured meter.

Eventually add:

```text
Trellis.ServiceLevelIndicators.Testing
```

This package should provide metric assertion helpers for AI-generated and hand-written tests.

## Histogram views/buckets

Provide optional helper APIs and documentation for recommended API latency histogram views/buckets. Do not force bucket configuration by default.

## Alternatives considered

### Keep `activity.status.code` as the primary outcome dimension

Rejected. `activity.status.code` is trace-oriented and does not model SLI-specific states such as `ClientError` and `Ignored` clearly enough for SLO math. The library should still update `Activity.Current` for trace correlation.

### Add `operation.count` immediately

Rejected for the first implementation. Histograms already produce a count series, and a separate counter risks drift unless every recording path updates both instruments consistently.

### Use seconds instead of milliseconds

Rejected. OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic-convention duration metrics use seconds, but Trellis SLI metrics intentionally emit latency in milliseconds to match the backend contract and existing library positioning.

## Open questions

- Exact recommended histogram bucket boundaries for the optional helper.
- Exact per-route classifier API shape.
- Exact analyzer packaging and suppression model for the later analyzer milestone.
